< 38 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 15 > And my father dwelt in a tent .

< 39 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 16 > And it came to pass that I , Nephi , being exceedingly young , nevertheless being large in stature , and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God , wherefore , I did cry unto the Lord ; and behold he did visit me , and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father ; wherefore , I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers .

< 40 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 17 > And I spake unto Sam , making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit . And it came to pass that he believed in my words .

< 41 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 18 > But , behold , Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words ; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them .

< 42 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 19 > And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me , saying  :  ] ] [ Godhead [ Blessed art thou , Nephi , because of thy faith , for thou hast sought me diligently , with lowliness of heart .

< 43 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 20 > And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments , ye shall prosper , and shall be led to a land of promise ; yea , even a land which I have prepared for you ; yea , a land which is choice above all other lands .

< 44 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 21 > And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee , they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord .

< 45 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 22 > And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments , thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren .

< 46 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 23 > For behold , in that day that they shall rebel against me , I will curse them even with a sore curse , and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also .

< 47 , 1 Nephi , 2 , 24 > And if it so be that they rebel against me , they shall be a scourge unto thy seed , to stir them up in the ways of remembrance . ] ]

< 48 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 1 > [ Nephi 1 [ And it came to pass that I , Nephi , returned from speaking with the Lord , to the tent of my father .

< 49 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 2 > And it came to pass that he spake unto me , saying  :  ] ] [ Lehi [ Behold I have dreamed a dream , in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem .

< 50 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 3 > For behold , Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers , and they are engraven upon plates of brass .

< 51 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 4 > Wherefore , the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban , and seek the records , and bring them down hither into the wilderness .

< 52 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 5 > And now , behold thy brothers murmur , saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them ; but behold I have not required it of them , but it is a commandment of the Lord .

< 53 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 6 > Therefore go , my son , and thou shalt be favored of the Lord , because thou hast not murmured . ] ]

< 54 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 7 > [ Nephi 1 [ And it came to pass that I , Nephi , said unto my father  :  I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded , for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men , save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them .

< 55 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 8 > And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad , for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord .

< 56 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 9 > And I , Nephi , and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness , with our tents , to go up to the land of Jerusalem .

< 57 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 10 > And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem , I and my brethren did consult one with another .

< 58 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 11 > And we cast lots who of us should go in unto the house of Laban . And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman ; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban , and he talked with him as he sat in his house .

< 59 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 12 > And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass , which contained the genealogy of my father .

< 60 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 13 > And behold , it came to pass that Laban was angry , and thrust him out from his presence ; and he would not that he should have the records . Wherefore , he said unto him  :  ] ] [ Laban [ Behold thou art a robber , and I will slay thee . ] ]

< 61 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 14 > [ Nephi 1 [ But Laman fled out of his presence , and told the things which Laban had done , unto us . And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful , and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness .

< 62 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 15 > But behold I said unto them that  :  As the Lord liveth , and as we live , we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us .

< 63 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 16 > Wherefore , let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord ; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's inheritance , for behold he left gold and silver , and all manner of riches . And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord .

< 64 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 17 > For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed , because of the wickedness of the people .

< 65 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 18 > For behold , they have rejected the words of the prophets . Wherefore , if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the land , behold , he would also perish . Wherefore , it must needs be that he flee out of the land .

< 66 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 19 > And behold , it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records , that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers ; < 67 , 1 Nephi , 3 , 20 > And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets , which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God , since the world began , even down unto this present time .
